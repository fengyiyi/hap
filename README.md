Prologue:
With the advent of cross-platform requirements and with pixel precision sites, there are new problems with the layout. This is especially true for the full screen mode sites. Implement an adaptive pixel-perfect design, it was a daunting task.

HAP - "HTML as Picture": the technology allows you to create a fully adaptive Pixel Perfect html sites with dynamic scaling of all html-document elements. Nesting site is done using EM and quantities per cent instead of the usual PX.

How to use:
At the present time we can offer to create your project Jquery plugin. The plugin has a function mini HTML-framework to maintain the adaptability of the site. You can use the plug-in to extend the functionality of other HTML-frameworks such as: Twitter Bootstrap.

Installation and setup - download and plug in before the closing </ body> Jquery plugin "HAP" (HTML as Picture). 
Recommendation on the site layout using the plugin "HAP":
•	Magnitude of the width of the container is set to "%". Indentation, font sizes, UL-elements installed in EM.
•	not use the small picture: the images on the buttons is better to resort to icon  fonts (eg: FontAwesome).
•	Do not use the font size is less than 10px. 
To avoid problems it is best to create the design of the future site resolution is 500/1000/1500/2000 / PX.

Note: For the container to 1000px width font size in the <BODY> is 100px.

Example for the site with the layout image 1000px:
The site has 2 columns of different widths, the first - 200, the width of the second column 800.
For the first column, set the width of 200 - 20%, for the second - 80%.
Further, in the first column font size 12px, the second 16px. For the first column, font size: 12/100 = 0.12em, for the second column: 16/100 = 0.16em.

Recommendation: Do not use the plug-in with a small resolution screens. Disable function, you can using CSS:

The output is cross-platform solution suitable for the realization of a pixel-perfect. With automatic scaling for any screen resolution.
We hope it will be useful to you.
